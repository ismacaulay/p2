# p2
My platform adventures!

### What is it?
p2 is a side project to build and deploy a personal PaaS (platform as a service). It is where I can learn how a PaaS is built and deployed by creating different applications that are interconnected. The end goal is to have a platform that anyone can download and host on their own server while being flexible enough to add new any new service.

### How it works?

Coming Soon!
